<p>I am taking this course because I have
enjoyed the introductory web design courses I've taken before
and I think the skills I'll learn and practice in this class
will be extremely beneficial going forward. I have some experience
with HTML, CSS, and Python, and have built a few very simple websites.
I've realized that even though I've taken several
programming/web development classes, I remember very little of what I've
done (which is pretty upsetting). Because of this, my number one goal in this course is to make
sure I truly understand what I'm doing and why (rather than just going
through the motions to finsh an assignment "successfully") so I can
retain and continue to build upon these skills in the future.</p>

<p>This website is evidently very relavent right now; my roommates and I have been
checking this dashboard obsessively a few times each day since we've been back on campus
so this was the first page that came to mind. I think these and other counter apps that
provide live updates on the spread of the virus are remarkable because they show how quickly
we can spread and access information from across the globe.</p>
<br></br>

<b><a href="https://www.tiktok.com/" target="_blank">TikTok</a></b>
<p>I think TikTok is super fascinating because has a super young demographic
and has exploded in popularity recently (so many of my friends and I have just joined
since the pandemic began). Gen Z is the first generation growing up with omnipresent
media and the kind of incessant content (in massive quantities) that TikTok provides, and it will be interesting
to see what sort of lasting cultural impression it forms.</p>

<p>Maybe not remarkable, but I just really like this website; they've always been big on sustainability and outdoor
activism and I like that their site promotes more than their products. There are spaces in the
website for bringing attention to contemporary environmental issues, storytelling, and reusing and repurposing
their clothing, and they've clearly been successful with extending their brand into other relavent spaces- I often
like poking around the articles and such. Also, it all looks very clean and cohesive, with beautiful and adventure-inspiring images.
